            <p class="box-item">The majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the
                world is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and
                distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. This system of
                conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural
                system is one of the major contributors to climate change.</p><br>

        <p class="food-world">Food storage is a way of decreasing the variability of the food supply in the face of
            natural,
            <br>
            inevitable variability.[1] It allows food to be eaten for some time (typically weeks to months) after
            harvest rather than <br> solely immediately. It is both a traditional domestic skill and, in the form of
            food
            logistics, an important industrial and commercial activity.
